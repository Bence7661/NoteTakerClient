The basicest of the basic project idea for my **React** practice project.

Goal is to use no-minimal frameworks to get the hang of it.  
After completion I will fork this repository and rework the whole thing using TypeScript and other **React** frameworks.

PS. I won't use any branching strategy either.  
I will just commit directly to `master`.
